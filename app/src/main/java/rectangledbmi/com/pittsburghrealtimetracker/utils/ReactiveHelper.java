         Jeremy Jao: note an edge case where if on a tablet and android says wifi has some sort of spotty
         internet, retrofit/okhttp will still try to send an HTTP request and will throw a Socket Timeout
         Exception. This is bad because the app will say "Internet disconnected please try again later,
         but in reality, most likely, it's still up
         (this is our only we know the Port Authority servers are up or down since they don't give us error responses).
         This means that users will have to restart the app for it to function again.

         I believe that Retrofit should be instead detecting what the Android OS is saying about
         wifi state and should return an IOException so I'm leaving this behavior for now... Perhaps
         to be revisited at some point.
